# Unsupervised-Learning

## Objective:
Apply dimensionality reduction technique â€“ PCA and train a model using principal components instead of training the model using raw data.

##Steps and tasks:
1. Data pre-processing - Understand the data and treat missing values (Use box plot), outliers (15 points)
2. Understanding the attributes - Find relationships between different attributes (Independent variables) and choose carefully which all attributes have to be a part of the analysis and why (15 points)
3. Use PCA from scikit learn and elbow plot to find out reduced number of dimension (which covers more than 95% of the variance) - 20 points
4. Use Support vector machines to classify the class(y) of vehicles and find the difference of accuracy with and without PCA on predictors(X). 20 points
5. Optional - Use grid search (try C values - 0.01, 0.05, 0.5, 1 and kernel = linear, rbf) and find out the best hyper parameters and do cross validation to find the accuracy.
